Navigating VS Code

General:

    Highlighting in terminal auto copies
    Right clicking in terminal auto pastes
    
    bash is a shell program that lets us run many programs using a text-based interface.
    VS Code is a text editor / IDE for many languages
    VS Code can open folders as well as files
        We have configured its built-in terminal to be Git Bash instead of default Powershell.
    .NET Core SDK helps us compile and run C#

        mv <path1> <path2>
            rename/move a file/directory
        clone creates a folder that is a copy of the original file. Used with github.

Git Bash (run in terminal):
        git clone
            download a local copy of a repository, with all the history of past versions.
        git pull
            update your local repository with all new commits from the remote (GitHub).
            will fail if any local changes conflict.
        git status
            report on state of local repository, including any untracked files, unpushed commits, etc.
        git add
            stage changes to be committed.
            use "." to stage all changes in the currect directory.
        git restore --staged <file>
            unstages changes
            use "." to unstage all changes in the current directory
        git commit
            record a permanent commit of changes to the local repository.
            use "-m" to add a commit message in-line. launches nano otherwise.
        git push
            upload all new commits to the remote (GitHub).
            will fail if there are already un-pulled commits there.
            will fail if you lack permissions.
Git workflow for class notes:
    1. clone
    2. pull
    3. repeat step 2
        git branch
            creates a new branch, which is a new commit path for your git tree
        git checkout <name> 
            puts directory on branch (name) for further commits
        git checkout -b [yourbranchname]
            puts directory on a newly created branch (yourbranchname) for further commits
        git merge <name>
            merges the contents of two branches and all their parents, the (name) and the currently selected directory
        git rebase <branchName>
            sets the current branch as a child commit of (branchname) commit
        git log
            Shows the commit tree, used for getting old hashes
                Hashes are long, but you only have to type enough for Git to uniquely identify the hash.
        ^
            Moves up one commit, used with ref names. (eg. git checkout bugFix^)
        ~<num>
            Moves up a specified number of commits. (eg. git checkout bugFix~4)
        git branch -f master HEAD~3
            Moves the master branch to 3 parents behind the head.
"Head" is the term used to described the currently checked out commit. 
    Typically follows the active branch, but can be detached from branch.
        

Dotnet (run in terminal):
    $ dotnet 
        new (creates new .NET projects)
        new console (New console application template)
        new console -o HelloWorld    (creates a HelloWorld application template using dotnet)
        dotnet restore (???)
        dotnet build
            compiles the code
        dotnet run 
            used to run projects, will also compile
        dotnet CLI (???)
    $ dotnet run -p HelloWorld   (says run a project (-p) with name (HelloWorld) in currently selected folder)
