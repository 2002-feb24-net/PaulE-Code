 List<T> class
    Code: using System.Collections.Generic; (allows for collections class, including lists)
    Lists can grows and shrink
    Can be referenced with indexes
    Methods
        .Add
            add to the list
        .Remove()
            removes by value or index
        .Count
            returns how many items are in a List
        .IndexOf
            returns index of a value in a list
        .Sort
            sorts the list in a standard way. for strings, this is alphebetically



C#
    variables are only visable within its scope ({})
    All methods must have certain things
        1. a name 
        2. a return value
        3. a list of perameters
    Access Modifiers
        private
            it can only be accessed by code inside the class
    Members
        In classes, every declaration is a Member
            properties are any variables with a getter ans setter
            the code is methods
            Constructor
                a constructor is a member with the same name at the class
                defines the code that is run upon class creation
    Exceptions
        The standard way of indicating that a method cannot complete its work successfully 
        The type of exception and the message associated with it describes the error
        Examples:
            InvalidOperationException
            ArgumentOutOfRangeException
        throw/catch
            You use the try and catch statements to mark a block of code that may throw exceptions and to catch those errors that you expect. 
            Example:
                try
                {
                    var invalidAccount = new BankAccount("invalid", -55);
                }
                catch (ArgumentOutOfRangeException e)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Exception caught creating account with negative balance");
                    Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
                }
    Methods
        Console.Write()   - does not go to next line
        Console.WriteLIne   -  does go to next line
        throw
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException()
        \t 
            inserts a tab to format the output
    Classes
         StringBuilder 
            class to format a string that contains one line. 
                var report = new System.Text.StringBuilder();
            Methods
                .AppendLine
                    report.AppendLine("Date\t\tAmount\tBalance\tNote");
    Data type
        DateTime
            DateTime.Now
        




Strings
    Console.ReadLIne() returns user input string
    StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase
        Used with .Equals to ignore case
    Strings are a reference type, not a data type
    $
        When you precede a string with the $ character, you can embed C# code in the string declaration.

    Methods
        .ToUpper()
        Convert.ToInt32(string)
            makes a string a int32 datatype
        .Contains()    
            check if a string contains another string 
            case sensitive by default, but ther eis another version of the method that isnt case sensitive
        .EndsWith()
        .StartsWith()
        .Equals()
            does the same thing as ==
        .IndexOf()
            searches through a string for some data
            tells you where in the string a char or string is located  (-1 for false)
        .SubString()
            tells it where to start.
                if given one perameter, starts there and goes to end 
                if given 2 perms, goes point to point
            includes the start point, use +1 to start after
        .Length
            Returns how long a string is
        .Split()
            Makes an array, breaking it based on what char you put as a perameter
        .PadLeft(int x, char pad)
        .PadRight(int x, char pad)
        .Replace(string x, string y)
            Replaces any x with y
            can be string or char
        .ToUpper()
            all caps
        .ToLower()
            all lowercase
        .Concat(array)
            combines string or char array into a string




Chars
    Like strings, but only one character. 
    Made with ' ' 
    Console.Read() returns user entered char




Arrays 
    Declared with []
        string[] words = 
    Can be of any data type you want
    Fixed length
    can only hold one type of thing in a single array
    Can access values by index
        int firstValue = numbers[0];
    Can also modify values by index
    Every data types has a default values  
        ints, 0
    Is a reference type, not a data type.
    Creation
        1) get it from a built in method
            string[] words = "a sentence".Split(' ');
        2) make it with default values
            int[] numbers = new int[int length];
        3) array initializer
            int[] moreNumbers = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5};
        4) 2nd array initializer
            int[] moreNumbers2 = {1,2,3,4,5};
    Methods
        Array.Reverse(array x)
            reverses the order of an array
        .Length
        Array.Copy(arry1,array2,array3)
            copies an existing array
            keep in mind that they have to be the same length
            can put in multiple arrays at once though
        Array.IndexOf(array x, value)
            finds the index of a value in a specified array
        .append(data)
            adds data to the end
        .delete(index)
            searches for and deletes data
        





Logic
    foreach
        You can iterate through arrays with a for each loop:
            var names = new List<string> { "Paul", "Ana", "Felipe" };
            foreach (var name in names)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name.ToUpper()}!");
                    }
     switch (Case)
            {   
                case 1:
                addNumbers(a);
                break;
                case 2:
                subtractNumbers(a);
                break;
                case 3:
                multiplyNumbers(a);
                break;
                case 4:
                divideNumbers(a);
                break;
            }




Extra
    ``` before paste to do blocks in Slack 
    for debug
        F1 > debug > generate assest > ??
        can also open file, specific project folder, and it will pop up in corner to install debug assets
